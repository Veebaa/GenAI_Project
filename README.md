# Generative AI Project

## What the AI will need:
Text Generation: To generate meaningful responses and maintain a conversation.
Code Generation: To generate or analyze code based on user input.
Conversational Flow: To handle dialogue contextually over multiple turns.

### Framework:
PyTorch

### Base Model:
Text Generation:
GPT-2 or GPT-3: OpenAI's language models are excellent for text generation.
Code Generation:
OpenAI Codex: Specialized in code.

### Development Environment:
Python (3.9+)
PyTorch (torch, torchvision)
Hugging Face Transformers (pip install transformers)
Dataset tools (pip install datasets, pip install tokenizers)

## Collect Training Data
Text Generation:
Open datasets like Common Crawl, BooksCorpus, or Wikipedia.
Focus on conversational datasets, e.g., Persona-Chat, ConvAI2.
Code Generation:
Datasets like The Stack (Hugging Face), CodeSearchNet, or GitHub repositories.
Include various programming languages for versatility.

## Fine-Tune the Model
### Steps:
#### Preprocessing:
Tokenize text/code using Hugging Face Tokenizers.
Use appropriate tokenization for code (e.g., preserving indentation).

#### Fine-Tuning:
Use a sequence-to-sequence approach for dialogue flow.

For PyTorch, load the pre-trained model and create a fine-tuning loop:

```
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
import torch

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Example of loading data and training
inputs = tokenizer("Hello, how are you?", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs, labels=inputs["input_ids"])
loss = outputs.loss
loss.backward()
```

For code, fine-tune on language-specific datasets using similar methods.

## Add Conversational Flow
To maintain context in conversations:

Use a rolling buffer of dialogue history.
Pass previous user inputs and AI responses as part of the input.

## Evaluate the Model
Text: Use metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or perplexity.
Code: Check functionality by executing generated code snippets.

## Build and Test a Frontend
For interaction:
Use a CLI, GUI, or a web interface (Flask/FastAPI for APIs).

Example CLI:

```
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    input_ids = tokenizer(user_input, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
    response = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100)
    print("AI:", tokenizer.decode(response[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Optimize for Utility
Add tools like syntax highlighting for code output.
Train the model to explain its decisions for research purposes.

## Deploy and Iterate
Once satisfied, deploy locally or via a cloud service, and improve iteratively based on results and feedback.
